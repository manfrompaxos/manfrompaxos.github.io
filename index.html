          <h2><i><u>BLUF&nbsp; (Bottom-Line Up-Front)</u></i></h2>
          <p>I spent my entire junior year in High-school studying
            "Number Theory" and "Algebraic Structures" for my AP tests.
            I guess the stars had lined up for a few years to have
            &nbsp; these&nbsp; as the course material for the&nbsp;
            period. And since the Silicon Valley I once knew has
            disappeared and the heritage of Andy has been wasted by
            unworthy successors (BK can you hear me?),&nbsp; it is time
            for me to return to my high school hobbies. Little did&nbsp;
            I know back then, but all that material&nbsp; I studied at
            school every morning and with tutors every evening is the
            base of cryptography.&nbsp; This opened up for me the worlds
            of Quantum Computing and Post-Nakamoto Distributed Systems.
            I guess having a big name in Fault-Tolerant Computing as a
            PhD&nbsp; advisor and being Leslie's neighbor had also&nbsp;
            something to do with it. <br>
          </p>
          <p>So if you want to know what is happening on Paxos these
            days&nbsp; please watch&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true"

              in Blue</a>, because I will now turn&nbsp; my attention to
            more counter-intuitive matters from the past. Like every
            athlete that has to cope with the counter-intuitive aspects
            of his sport (e.g. skiers must lean into the fall line!!),
            mathletes interested in establishing trust where no central
            authority figure is allowed to enter equally must learn to
            cope with many counter-intuitive ideas.<br>
          </p>
          <p>To that end, I am linking here my hand-written notes from
            my lectures in the two courses I am teaching this semester:
            "Design of Quantum Computers" and "Blockchain
            Engineering".&nbsp; I am going to upload my QC notes first.<br>
